If you're interested in RAP across government more generally, contact the [RAP Champion/s](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/about-us/champion-networks/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/#list-of-champions) in your department, and  get involved in the #rap_collaboration slack channel on the [gov data science slack workspace](https://govdatascience.slack.com/).
